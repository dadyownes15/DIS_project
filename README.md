Final project for the course "Database and Information Systems" at Copenhagen University at the DIKU apartment.


# Running our Curriculim finder

Navigate to DIS_project, so it becomes your directories root.

Write out the following in your terminal:

flask run

From this all tables will be created and dataloaded, and once that has been succesfully terminated, you will be able to open a link to your localhost (http://127.0.0.1:5000).
